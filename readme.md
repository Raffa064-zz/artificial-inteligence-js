# Artificial Inteligence

## About

With artificial-inteligence.js module, you can get an simple way to use artificial inteligence MLP.

The current version include:

- Tanh activation function
- Crossing over method (Simple weight and bias split)
- Mutation method (Random mutation)

NOTE: This module are written for reinforcement learn... Also I will not add any implementation of backpropagation.

## Future features
I'm thinking to add more features for future versions like:
- More activation functions
- Train enviroment structure
